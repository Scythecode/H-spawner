A silly little project that prints a big H to your terminal!. 

Install instructions (unix operating systems with bash installed only!!): clone this repo. cd into repo. make the script exectutable "chmod +x silly.sh". run with ./silly.sh. enjoy your H! 

I might recreate this in rust if this gets enough stars! (btw pls star this)
